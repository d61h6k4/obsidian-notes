##### Do not mix biases with regular features!
(Rule 36)
> Note that it is important to keep any positional features somewhat separate from the rest of the model because of this asymmetry between training and testing. Having the model be the sum of a function of the positional features and a function of the rest of the features is ideal. For example, donâ€™t cross the positional features with any document feature.
