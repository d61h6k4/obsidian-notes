**Popularity bias**, one of the main biases in recommender systems, makes popular items
being recommended too frequently while less popular ones are recommended among
small groups of users (Brynjolfsson, Hu & Smith, 2006). *Due to popularity bias, the non-
popular items have less chance to be recommended, but a large number of users are also
interested in and willing to explore unpopular items* (Abdollahpouri, Mansoury, Burke &
Mobasher, 2019). In this case, the **popularity bias affects the fairness and accuracy of
recommendations and may furth destroy user experience on the platform**. 
In addition to popularity bias, **exposure bias** is also a challenge in recommender systems. **Exposure bias** occurs when the systems fail to find out all of the usersâ€™ diverse interests because no observed interaction happened before between users and items (Khenissi & Nasraoui, 2020). In this scenario, the systems keep providing the same types of recommendations based on observed interaction again and again, which leads to a filter bubble problem and decreases the diversity of recommendations.
